I am very interested in the graphic designer position posted on Monster, and hope to have the chance to interview for this exciting opportunity.

Ltd.: Japan's renowned Konica, Mimaki and mutoh organization were the agents. Wahab Trading Co, was the agent of Korean famous DGI (Digital Graphics Incorporation). I have had the opportunity to work with two of the above companies and technicians from graphics and large-format digital printers trained in 2010.from Korea.
Highlights of my skills include:
•	Print and Digital Graphic Design,
•	Website Design, Packaging Design.•		•	Artwork and Photorealistic Illustration
•	Color Rendering and Correction.
I design creative with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator efficiently. Web Design has the expertise of HTML, DHTML, and Java Script. And multi user’s software such as human, accounts, Inventory, production and sales have been designing analyzing and developed.
